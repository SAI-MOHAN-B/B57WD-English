JS concepts:
data types, conditional statements, loops, arrays...


Data type of a vaiable??
typeof();
Typecasting: Converting from one data type to another...
{}-> flower brace : conditional as well as group of codes
()-> methods..
[]-> Arrays..

Here the data type that we read ios of type string
to convert string to number we use the parseInt()

It converts the string to Number
Ex: "23" -> 23
var a = parseInt(userInput[0])
console.log(typeof(a))

variable is a name given to memory Location

When You have an Array and you need to print it 
We need for loop
Why for Loop?
For loop is a fixed execution Looping statement !!!!
Now the array memory seems to be fixed during the execution of the program
so we need to use for loop when you have an array...
